## The Task

Implementing, in Ruby, a checkout system that can scan items, apply promotions, and calculate a total.


## My Approach

I began by doing some simple design and domain modelling with a pencil and paper. Two initial objects emerged - an item and a checkout. I test-drove the development of an Item with some basic properties and a Checkout that could scan items, add them to a collection and calculate a total.

I then test-drove two promotions objects - TenPercentOver60 and LavenderHeartsMultiple - and a PromotionalRules object that iterates through the promotions and applies them to a total.

Next, I extracted a Subtotal object from Checkout to make updating the subtotal easier, and I extracted a PriceFormatter to separate out the pretty-formatting of the checkout total.

I refactored to ensure that promotions are applied in the correct order (items discounts first, then total discounts), no matter what order they're passed in.

I then refactored out the very specific promotions, and replaced them with two generic promotion objects - MultipleItemsPromotion and PercentagePromotion - which perform the same function but can be passed arguments to vary the amounts/items being promoted.

## Assumptions

* Items can be scanned in any order
* Promotions can be included in any order
* Promotions are changeable
* New items/promotions can be added
* Promotions should only be able to be processed once at checkout

## Installation

* Fork this repo
* Clone it to your local environment
* On the command line, `cd` into the directory
* Run `bundle`


## Running the program

* To view example results, run `rake examples:all`
* To view test results and coverage, run `rspec`

You can also interact with the program from the command line in IRB/PRY:

````
require './lib/item.rb'

require './lib/checkout.rb'

require './lib/promotional_rules.rb'

lavender_hearts_offer = MultipleItemsPromotion.new(item_code = "001", threshold = 2, discount = 0.75)

ten_percent_offer = PercentagePromotion.new(threshold = 60, percentage = 10)

promotional_rules = PromotionalRules.new(lavender_hearts_offer, ten_percent_offer)

co = Checkout.new(promotional_rules)

lavender_heart = Item.new("001", "Lavender Heart", 9.25)

cufflinks = Item.new("002", "Personalised Cufflinks", 45.00)

t_shirt = Item.new("003", "Kids T-shirt", 19.95)

co.scan(lavender_heart)

co.scan(t_shirt)

co.scan(lavender_heart)

co.scan(cufflinks)

co.total
 => "Â£73.76"
 ````


## Ideas/To Do

* Create other types of promotion
* Create a receipt object that presents a formatted list of items/prices/discounts
* Refactor Checkout#items into a separate Basket object.
